# RangeFinder

A high-performance .NET range query library for general numeric ranges.
Designed as a lightweight alternative to RangeTree, optimized for scenarios where all ranges are known upfront.

**Part of the RangeFinder ecosystem** - Core library with additional packages for visualization, data generation, and analysis.

## What's New

- **üêõFixed negative range handling** - Resolves incorrect query results when ranges contain negative values (does not affect positive-only ranges)
- **üè≠Added RangeFinderFactory** - Simplified factory methods for RangeFinder construction from various data sources
- **üß™Enhanced Testing** - Property-based testing and improved coverage

## Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized binary search with fast construction and microsecond-level queries
- **Generic Support**: Works with any numeric type using `INumber<TSelf>` interface
- **Compatibility**: RangeTree-compatible Query APIs for easy migration

_Note: This Core package contains only the core range-finding algorithms. Additional packages for visualization and data I/O utilities are planned for future releases._

## Quick Start

```csharp
using RangeFinder.Core;

// Simple tuple-based creation
var finder = RangeFinderFactory.Create(
[
    (1.0, 2.2, 100),
    (2.0, 3.2, 200),
    (3.0, 4.0, 300)
]);

// Query overlapping ranges
var values = finder.Query(2.0, 2.9);         // Returns: 100, 200
var overlaps = finder.QueryRanges(2.0, 3.0); // Returns: [1.0,2.2]=100, [2.0,3.2]=200
```

## Development Status

RangeFinder is actively developed toward v1.0. The core API is stable and ready for evaluation, prototyping, and non-critical applications. For mission-critical systems, consider waiting for v1.0.0.

## RangeFinder Ecosystem

**Core** (this package)

- High-performance range queries with O(log N + K) complexity
- RangeTree API compatibility for easy migration  
- Generic support for any `INumber<T>` type

**Related Packages** (available on GitHub)

- **RangeFinder.IO** - Data generation and CSV/Parquet serialization
- **RangeFinder.Visualizer** - Interactive range visualization tool _(planned for NuGet)_

## Performance & Documentation

Our benchmarks show promising performance improvements over established libraries, with query times typically in the microsecond range for datasets up to 50M ranges.
